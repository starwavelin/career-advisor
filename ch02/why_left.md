# 如何回答“为什么离开上一份工作？”


## Why do interviewers ask this question?
* Did you leave for a good reason?
* Did you leave voluntarily?
* Did you leave on good terms? -- if you can state you are still in touch with your previous manager (even better, he is one of your [references](https://biginterview.com/blog/2012/05/job-reference-check.html)), that will demonstrate you are a good employee having a good relationship skills.
* What are your work values? -- Your reasons for leaving a position can say a lot of you. Did you leave for positive reasons or because you felt slighted (a. 轻微的 被轻视的) or unappreciated? Sometimes it makes sense to leave a job if you are not appreciated, but please express this reason skillfully.


## Why did you leave your most recent position?
* 若现在不在职
请注意，至少北美职场对现在不在职的Candidate是有偏见的，尽量别造成这种局面。
However, it’s good to be aware that this bias exists when addressing the question of why you are available.  And if you have been between jobs for a long period of time,you should be prepared to describe the proactive steps you have been taking to improve your skills — training, volunteer work or consulting projects.

The subject of why you’re leaving is a bit trickier in this case because you probably don’t have the luxury of keeping your answer 100% positive. If you left and didn’t leave for another opportunity, there was obviously an issue of some kind.

Maybe it was your issue or maybe it was the company’s issue. Either way, you have to be able to explain why it was a reasonable separation and why you are a fantastic and very attractive candidate.

Resist the temptation to trash talk your previous employer. Even if the company was totally dysfunctional, you should avoid sounding too negative.

* 如果是解聘
如果是不因KPI原因的解聘，那么，重点讲自己的对公司的贡献。我们举个回答案例吧：
> Unfortunately, the company’s biggest client went out of business at the beginning of the year and that had a major effect on revenues.

> As a result, they had to eliminate some positions and I was among the five most recently hired in our department. I am proud of the work that I did there, I got stellar (a. 星球的，一流的) performance reviews, and my former manager is one of my strongest references.

* 如果是基于表现缘由的解聘
If you were fired for performance reasons, you should mention any extenuating (a. 情有可原的) circumstances, but avoid putting all of the blame on others. For example, if the job requirements or expectations changed after you were hired, make that clear. Sometimes, expectations change as a result of new management, budget cuts, or a shift in strategy.

If you were fired for any reason, you should make a point of  highlighting lessons learned from the experience. The goal here is to assure the interviewer that it was an isolated incident and that you would not be a risky hire.
